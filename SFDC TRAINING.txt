                              1) One to Many    =>  Look up, Master-Details, Hierarchical and Self Relationship

                              2) Many to Many => Junction Object

 

 

Look up Relationship:

===================

               1) Loosely coupled, also referred to aggregation in database

                              i) No cascade delete

               2) Lookup can be between

                              i) Two Custom Objects

                              ii) Two Standard Objects

                              iii) One Custom and One Standard Object

               3) There can be a maximum of 40 lookup relationships per child

               4) Child field value may be optional.

 

 

Activity1:

=======

               Create a lookup relationship between Job Application and Position

 

 

Master Details Relationship:

========================

               1) Tightly coupled also referred to as Composition in database terminologies.

               2) Child field value is always required.

               3) Allows Cascade delete of child records.

               4) Ownership & Sharing on child objects are inherited from parent object.

               5) Can be defined between two custom objects or between a custom object and a standard object, but Standard Object cannot be a Child

               6) Maximum 2 master relationships per detail object

               7) While setting up the Master-Detail Relationship between Parent and Child ensure Child Object doesn't have any records.

               8) Master Details Relationship can be up to 3 layers deep

 

 

Note: Master Object=> Parent

            Details  Object=> Child

 

Activity1:

========

Create a Master-Detail relationship between Interviewer and Position Objects

 

Activty2:

=======

 

Create a Master-Detail relationship between Position and Job Posting Objects (You must create an object called Job Posting)

 

Activity3:

========

Create a Master-Detail relationship between JobPosting and JobPostingSite objects.

 

Hierarchical Relationship:

=====================

1) Hierarchical relationships link one user to another.

2) Links a user record with another user record.

3) Only used for user-to-user.

4) Commonly used in Approval processes.

 

Activity1:

========

Create Hierarchical Relationship between Position and User Object where User Object is named as Hiring Manager

 

Lookup Filter:

============

1) To take valid data from lookup field we use Look up filter

2) Used to limit search results for users.

3) Can be created on lookup, master-detail and hierarchical fields.

4) Look up filter are two types

Static lookup: can be done using value reference

Dynamic lookup: can be done using field reference

 

Activity:

=======

Create a Look Filter to take only People Manager's as Hiring Manager's

 

Hiring Manager>People Manager  => Equals        =>true

Error: Hiring Manager must be a people manager

 

 

Self Relationship:

===============

1) Self relationships link an object to itself.

2) Allows for one record to reference another record of the same object.

3) Only possible with Lookup relationships.

4) Ownership, sharing, deletion are identical to Lookup relationships.

 

Activity:

=======

Apply a lookup filter between on the Position object to restrict the options available for Department.

Tasks:

Create a lookup relationship with Position Object.

Add a lookup filter by department.

 

Related Position>Department  => equals => Field => Position>Department

Position>Record ID => Not Equal to =>Field =>Related Position>Record ID

 

Error Message: The related position must be in the same department. You cannot relate a position to itself.

 

 

Many-to-Many Relationship:

=========================

               Allow for the relationship of two objects in a many-to-many fashion.

 

               Ex: One Job can have many Applicants. Similarly one applicant can apply for many jobs.

 

               Junction Objects can be classified into two types

               1) Functional Junction Object

                              (If a Custom Object is having two lookups then it becomes functional junction object)

               2) Technical Junction Object

                              (If a Custom Object is having 2 MD relationships then it becomes technical junction               object)

 

Junction Object:

==============

               1) A junction object is a custom object with two relationships.

               2) Used to link two other objects in order to build a many-to-many relationship between them.

               3) When creating a junction object, consider the following:

                              i) Name the object with a label that indicates its purpose.

                              ii) Use the auto-number data type.

                              iii) Junction object records are deleted when either associated master record is              deleted and placed in the Recycle Bin.

                              iv) However, junction object records are deleted permanently when both the associated master objects are deleted.
